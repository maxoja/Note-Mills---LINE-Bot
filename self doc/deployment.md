To deploy to Heroku
- install heroku CLI
- login using the CLI


There are 3 relevant files Heroku requires to use its deployment service.
You need to set them up and put them in the root of your repository.
All these are provided in this repo already but it's useful to be aware of these for future work.

- `runtime.txt` specifying Python version
- `requirements.txt` specifying all dependency needed. Can be generated by running `pip freeze > requirements.txt`
- `Procfile` specifying how you want to run your app

Depending on the method you want to deploy, either of the following 2.
- using Heroku CLI
- using GitHub synchronisation
You will need different setups. GitHub synchronisation is quite easy to try it out yourself so this note will pay attention to the Heroku CLI method. And these are the steps.
- install Heroku CLI
- login usin the CLI
- (if you didn't) clone your repository to your development machine
- make sure (if there is) that you have committed any changes to a branch you want to deploy
- with terminal or cmd, change directory to your local repository
- run `heroku create <app name of your choice>
- run `git push heroku <your branch>:master
- (or this if you want to deploy master) `git push heroku master`

After deployment is complete these are useful util commands
- `heroku ps` check running processes and their statuses
- `heroku open` open deployment URL
- `heroku logs --tail` check server log feed
- `heroku restart` restart your app's dyno
